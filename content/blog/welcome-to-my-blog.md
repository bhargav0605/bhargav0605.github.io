I'm excited to announce the launch of my new portfolio website! This marks a significant shift in how I share my knowledge and experiences in the Cloud and DevOps space.

## Why This Change?

After using Hashnode for my blog posts, I decided to bring everything under one roof. This new site is built with Hugo, a lightning-fast static site generator, and features a clean monochrome design that puts the focus on content.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Kubernetes deep-dives**: From basic concepts to advanced cluster management
- **DevOps best practices**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and automation
- **Cloud architecture**: AWS, Azure, and multi-cloud strategies
- **Security insights**: Container security, secrets management, and compliance
- **Real-world projects**: Case studies from my work across healthcare, AI, and telecom

## Technical Stack

This site is powered by:

- **Hugo**: Static site generation for blazing-fast performance
- **GitHub Pages**: Simple, reliable hosting
- **Markdown**: Clean, version-controlled content
- **Monochrome Design**: Focusing on readability and content over flashy colors
